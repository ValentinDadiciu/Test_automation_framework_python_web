# Project BDD Testing Framework

##### I conducted tests on various functionalities of the Magento website. I verified the integrity and functionality of the login and registration pages, tested the process of adding products to the shopping cart, and confirmed its proper functioning. Additionally, I explored the news page and tested the search button. During the tests, I ensured that products added to the shopping cart were successfully selected, including specifying the desired size and color.

### Register test:
The automated testing on Magento registration page yielded the following results:
- URL Verification: Confirmed correct URL for the registration page.
- Empty Field Handling: Checked error display for empty mandatory fields.
- Successful Registration: Validated successful registration with correct data.

Overall, tests ensured proper functionality and error handling on the registration page.

### Login test:
The login feature testing on Magento involved the following scenarios:
1. **URL Verification**: Ensured the correct URL for the login page.
2. **Login with Unregistered Email**: Validated error message display for login attempts with unregistered email addresses.

The tests covered essential functionalities and error handling for the login page.

### News test:
In the news feature testing on the Whats New Page of Magento, the following scenario was executed:
- URL Verification**: Ensured that the correct URL for the Whats New page is displayed.

This scenario validates that the page is correctly loaded with the expected URL, ensuring users are directed to the intended content.

### Search test:
These tests verify the search functionality of the website. Here's a summary:
   - The test begins by entering the keyword "troy" into the search field.
   - After entering the keyword, the search magnifying button is clicked to initiate the search.
   - The test verifies that the user is redirected to the search results page.
   - Finally, the test verifies that search results are displayed correctly on the page.

This scenario ensures that users can successfully search for existing items on the website using the search functionality and that the search results are correctly displayed.

### Add to Cart test:
This test verifies the functionality of adding a product to the shopping cart on the website. Specifically, the test aims to validate that a user can:
1. Search for a specific product (in this case, "troy").
2. Select the size and color options for the product.
3. Add the product to the shopping cart.
4. Verify that the added product appears in the shopping cart with a quantity of "1" item.

Essentially, this test ensures that the functionality of adding products to the shopping cart works correctly and that users can successfully perform this action on the website.


# Summary:
- The Test Automation Framework Python Web facilitates the adoption of best testing practices and promotes efficient software development through the BDD approach.
- The project includes 11 successful test scenarios, providing comprehensive coverage of the tested functionalities.
